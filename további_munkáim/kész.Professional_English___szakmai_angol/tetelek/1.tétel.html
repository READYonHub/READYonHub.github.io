        <p title="Most egy tésztagyár online webáruházán dolgozom. Én vagyok a frontend fejlesztő. Itt van a Sprint feladatlistája. Szeretném elmondani, mit csináltam tegnap.">Now I’m working on the online web shop of a pasta factory. I’m the frontend developer. Here I have the Sprint Task List. I would like to tell you what I did yesterday. </p>

        <p title="Tegnap feltöltöttem a szövegeket a termékekhez; Lefordítottam a termékek leírását (mert külföldi megrendelőink vannak), a szövegeket formáztam.">Yesterday I uploaded the texts to the products; I translated the descriptions of the products (because we have foreign customers) and formatted the texts.</p>

        <p>
            Today I’m going to check the texts and html codes and I run the error searching on the FireFox. It’s a good idea to make our document with picture if it is possible. In this way, we can minimize the length and complexity of our documentation. System users like having pictures, diagrams, tables and bulleted lists for quick reference.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is also important to give examples. They are an excellent way for end users to quickly grasp concepts that they may not fully understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            I design background, add colours, format the family fonts, size, search for background images, videos, photos, music, advertisements (The Pasta factory has its own advertisements)  and animations. After that I’d like to choose the best images, videos and advertisements. Then I ask a short feedback from the boss. If it is proper I upload the prices of the products. I won’t forget about responsive web design, in order that the web site conforms to all types of screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other team members also tell what they did the previous day and what they will do today. They face some impediments. I also may have obstacles. Here is my Impediments List. It may happen that there is low speed internet connection, because too many colleagues work at the same time. I may have software problems for example: adobe html5 (The web-authoring program doesn’t work properly). Another problem can be that there isn’t FireFox on PC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Searching for animations and sounds might go to deadline. But it’s not a problem, it’s not necessary because sounds effects may be annoying. When testing our system, we should have tried to do our best to break the software any way we could. If there is any problem, make a workaround and provide it to our users and the help desk. We will not only save the end users from a lot of frustration but also the help desk from a lot of extra calls.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think a web shop works well if it also has a web application as nowadays almost everybody has got a smartphone and uses it for online shopping.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I pass the web design to the backend development to finish the work. If the backend developer is ready we can release the web shop to the consumers.
